Man kann in der Batch Datei testen ob das Netzlaufwerk da ist, müsste eigentlich wie folgt funkitonieren:
You may test in a batch file, if the network share is available. Should work like:

@echo off

if exist ComputerNameOpenShare goto store
echo NetworkShare not found
goto END

:store
robocopy.exe …….

:END 



=======================

Syntax: robocopy Source Destination [File [File]..] 

Source (Quelle) Specifies the source directory. Source can use the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) format ("\\myserver") or reference a local drive 

Destination (Ziel) Specifies the destination directory. Destination can use the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) format ("\\myserver") or reference a local drive 

File Specifies the file or files to copy. Wildcard characters can also be used. *.* is the default value of File. It specifies all files 
in the directory specified by Source 

/S Copies all subdirectories, excluding empty ones 
/E Copies all subdirectories, including empty ones 
/LEV:n Copies only the top n levels of the source directory tree. n indicates the number of levels 
/Z Copies files in restartable mode 
/B Copy files in Backup mode. Copying files in backup mode is not restartable. Backup mode may be able to copy files that restartable mode cannot.... 
/ZB Use restartable mode; if access is denied, use backup mode 
/COPY:Copy_Flag The /COPY: parameter copies specified file properties. The default is /COPY:DAT Flag Description
D File data 
A File attributes 
T File time time stamps 
S File security. This attribute copies the NTFS Access Control Lists (ACL). 
O File ownership. This attribute copies the NTFS file ownership information. 
U File auditing. This attribute copies the NTFS file auditing information.
 
Note Source and destination volumes must both be NTFS to copy Security, Ownership or Auditing information. 
/SEC Copy files with security. Equivalent to /COPY:DATS. 
/COPYALL 
Copy all file attributes. Equivalent to /COPY:DATSOU. 
/NOCOPY Does not copy any file attributes.  
/PURGE Deletes destination files and directories that no longer exist in the source directory.  
/MIR Mirror a directory tree. The equivalent of /E /PURGE.  
/MOV Moves files, deleting the source after copying to the destination. 
/MOVE Moves files and directories, deleting the source after copying to the destination. 
/A+:{R | A | S | H | N}  Adds the given attributes to copied files. The following table lists the valid attributes: Attribute Description 
R Read only 
S System 
A Archive 
H Hidden 
N Not content indexed  
/CREATE Create directory tree and zero-length files only. 
/FAT Creates destination files using 8.3 FAT file names only. 
/FFT Assume FAT File Times (2-second interval). Useful for copying to third-party systems that declare a volume to be NTFS but only implement file times with a 2-second interval. 
/256 Turn off very long path support. Very long path names are those longer than 256 characters 
/MON:n Monitors the source for change. The n parameter specifies the number of changes allowed in the source. If this number is exceeded, processing restarts. 
/MOT:m Monitors the source for change. The m parameter specifies the number of minutes to wait before checking for changes. If there are changes, processing restarts. 
/RH:hhmm-hhmm Defines the time slot during which starting new copies is allowed. Useful for restricting copies to certain times of the day. Both values must be 24–hour times in the range 0000 to 2359. 
/PF Makes more frequent checks to see if starting new copies is allowed (per file rather than per pass). Useful in stopping copy activity more promptly at the end of the run hours time slot. 
/IPG:ms Inter-Packet Gap in milliseconds. This parameter is used to free bandwidth on slow network links 
/A Copies only files with the archive attribute set. 
/M Copies only files with the archive attribute set, but removes the archive attribute from source files. 
/IA:{R | A | S | H | N | C | E} Includes only files with any of the given Attributes set. The following table lists the valid attributes: Attribute Description

/MIN:bytes Excludes files smaller than specified. 
/MAXAGE:{days | YYYYMMDD} Excludes files with a Last Modified Date older than n days or specified date. If n is less than 1900, then n is expressed in days. Otherwise, n is a date expressed as YYYYMMDD. 
/MINAGE:{days | YYYYMMDD} Excludes files with a Last Modified Date newer than n days or specified date. If n is less than 1900, then n is expressed in days. Otherwise, n is a date expressed as YYYYMMDD. 
/MAXLAD:{days | YYYYMMDD} Excludes files with a Last Access Date older than n days or specified date. If n is less than 1900, then n is expressed in days. Otherwise, n is a date expressed as YYYYMMDD. 
/MINLAD:{days | YYYYMMDD} Excludes files with a Last Access Date newer than n days or specified date. If n is less than 1900, then n is expressed in days. Otherwise, n is a date expressed as YYYYMMDD.
